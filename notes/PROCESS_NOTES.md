## When to Introduce Process Artifacts

There is an intentional delay in introducing certain governance artifacts (e.g., intake/review templates, templates README).

Rationale:
- These artifacts introduce process and friction by design.
- Adding them too early risks premature formalization, performative overhead, and reduced experimentation.
- They should be introduced only when there is felt pain (repeated debates, inconsistent evaluations, misuse of templates).

Signal to add:
- Re-evaluating the same tools or ideas repeatedly
- Difficulty saying no consistently
- Confusion about template usage or promotion

Until those signals appear, restraint is preferable to completeness.
