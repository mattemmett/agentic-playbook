# Notes and Sense-Making

This folder exists to support **Phase 1: Curation** in the lifecycle of the Agentic Playbook.

Its purpose is to provide a safe, explicit space for uncertainty, exploration, and incomplete thinking without polluting the playbook itself.

The contents of this folder are **not doctrine**, **not decisions**, and **not commitments**.

They are inputs.

---

## Why This Folder Exists

Strong playbooks fail when:
- uncertainty has nowhere to go,
- evolving understanding is forced directly into doctrine,
- or unresolved questions are answered implicitly through drift.

This folder exists to prevent those failure modes.

It allows ideas, questions, and observations to be captured **before** they are ready to become:
- principles,
- patterns,
- decisions,
- or templates.

By giving provisional thinking a home, the playbook itself remains stable, intentional, and coherent.

---

## What Belongs Here

This folder may contain:
- open questions and unresolved tensions,
- early observations from experiments,
- notes on emerging tools or research,
- concerns about assumptions in the playbook,
- ideas that feel promising but unvalidated.

Content here is expected to be:
- incomplete,
- exploratory,
- and subject to change.

That is a feature, not a flaw.

---

## What Does *Not* Belong Here

This folder is **not** for:
- finalized principles,
- architectural decisions,
- production guidance,
- or reusable templates.

Once something reaches that level of confidence, it should move out of this folder and into the appropriate artifact (e.g., ADRs, templates, or the playbook itself).

---

## How to Use This Folder

- Add entries only when something feels uncertain, unresolved, or in tension.
- Do not force structure prematurely.
- Do not seek to resolve everything immediately.
- Revisit notes periodically, not constantly.

Most entries will never be promoted. Some will.

The value of this folder is not completeness, but **clarity over time**.

---

## Relationship to the Playbook

The playbook captures *what we believe*.

This folder captures *what we are still learning*.

The boundary between the two should be maintained deliberately. When something crosses that boundary, it should do so explicitly and with rationale.

---

## A Note on Discipline

This folder enables progress without chaos only if it is used intentionally.

If everything lives here, nothing is learned.  
If nothing lives here, the playbook will stagnate.

Use it lightly, honestly, and without pressure to resolve.

That is enough.
